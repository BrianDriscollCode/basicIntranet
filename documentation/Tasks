  B. JavaScript Portion
    I - add event listeners to buttons
    II - add opacity changes to newsImages
    III - Add title, author changes
    IV - add view update changes when article
        is clicked

        reversed (first button is actually
        labeled button 3) to maintain the order

2. Add media query for width of mainContent
